//oops - Classes and objects

//C++ --> intially called -->C with classes by stroustroup
//class -->extension of sturctures (in C)
// structures had limitation
//      - members are bydefault public
//      - No methods
//classes --> structure + more
//classes --> can have methods and properties
//classes --> can make fwe members as private & few as public
//structures in C++ are typedefed
//You can declare objects along with the class declaration like this:
/*class Employee{
    //class defination
}harry, liza, fiza;*/
//harry.salary = 8; makes no sense if salary is private
